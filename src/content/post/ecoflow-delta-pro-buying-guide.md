Step into the future of advanced power management with the EcoFlow Delta Pro portable power station. This innovative device goes beyond the ordinary, transforming the concept of portable power stations into high-capacity home backup batteries equipped with an array of groundbreaking features. Whether you're looking for a reliable backup power source or a way to make the most of solar power, the Delta Pro has you covered. In this article, we'll break down the different buying options to help you determine which configuration might best fit your needs.

#### **Delta Pro: Power Management Redefined**

Priced at $3,100, including a transfer switch, the EcoFlow Delta Pro is an investment in reliable and efficient power management. The transfer switch, equipped with six circuits, enables the power station to integrate seamlessly with your home's power grid. The Delta Pro sets itself apart with its rapid charging capabilities, taking just 2.7 hours via an AC outlet and a mere 2 hours with up to 1600W of solar power. This is significantly faster than many competitors, ensuring you have power when you need it. It's also the first portable power station that can recharge at EV stations worldwide, adding a layer of convenience. Beyond power and convenience, the Delta Pro is built for longevity, with a durable LFP battery that supports up to 10 years of use.

The DELTA Pro also introduces the unique X-Boost technology, which allows the unit to increase its 3.6KW of continuous AC power to 4.5kw. Think of X-Boost as a backup for your backup. In times when you need more continuous power, you can draw more, like during a power outage. However, this will drain the battery faster, using up more of your battery's life cycles.

#### **EcoFlow Delta Pro with Extra Smart Battery: Doubling Your Power Capacity**

The EcoFlow Delta Pro with an extra smart battery is a power solution that offers extended capacity without compromising on output. The additional battery, which lacks input options, primarily serves to enhance the overall battery capacity. This means that while the continuous output power remains steady at 3.6kWh, the duration of power usage is effectively doubled.

The extra battery's cost can range from $2000-$2500. However, in this scenario, Amazon offers it for $2000, bringing the total cost of this setup with a transfer switch to $5300. This setup is a testament to the flexibility and scalability of the EcoFlow Delta Pro, allowing you to customize your power solution to meet your specific needs.

#### **Two EcoFlow Delta Pros with Voltage Hub: Doubling the Power**

For those seeking the pinnacle of power solutions, consider the configuration of two EcoFlow Delta Pros paired with a Voltage Hub. This setup maintains the battery system capacity at 7.2kWh, similar to the previous configuration. However, the real game-changer here is the doubling of the AC output power to 7.2KW. This is made possible by each unit being equipped with a 3600W pure sine wave inverter.

The surge power also sees a significant boost, reaching a staggering 14.4KW. This is due to the combined output power and battery capacity of the two units. Despite the increased power, the charging times remain consistent with the single Delta Pro option. This is because each unit charges separately, maintaining the same AC charging time of 2.7 hours and solar charging time of 2 hours.
This configuration is priced at $6,000 with a transfer switch, making it the premium option for those who require the utmost in power and performance.

#### **Smart Home Panel: A Worthwhile Upgrade**

No matter which configuration you choose, the Smart Home Panel is a valuable upgrade to consider. This addition transforms your Delta Pro into a smart energy management system, allowing for load shifting based on Time of Use (TOU) rate schedules. This essentially enables your system to buy low and sell high, optimizing your energy usage and cost.

The Smart Home Panel also converts your home backup battery into a solar battery that can compete with industry standards. This upgrade allows you to feed power back to the grid and sell solar if you have a favorable net-metering program. The Smart Home Panel also offers ten circuits, providing greater flexibility in how you distribute power in your home.

The upgrade to the Smart Home Panel will add approximately $1,300 to $1,400 to your investment. However, considering the additional features and capabilities offered by the Smart Home Panel, it's an investment that can pay off in the long run for the right person.
