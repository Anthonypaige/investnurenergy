    {
      title: 'What is an Air-Source Heat Pump?',
      description:
        'An air-source heat pump serves as a comprehensive climate control solution. During the hot summer months, it extracts heat from the interior of your home and expels it outside. Conversely, in the winter, it reverses this process by capturing heat from the external air and transferring it into your home, providing a consistent indoor temperature year-round.',
    },
    {
      title: 'What Makes Air-Source Heat Pumps a Good Choice?',
      description:
        'Air-source heat pumps are known for their energy efficiency, which often translates to reduced electricity bills. They are versatile, capable of both heating and cooling your home. This dual functionality makes them a cost-effective and practical option for maintaining indoor comfort throughout the year.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Any Drawbacks to Using Air-Source Heat Pumps?',
      description:
        'While they have been less effective in extremely cold climates, recent technological advancements are enhancing their performance even in such conditions. For those who live in colder areas and are still concerned, dual-source hybrid systems are available, combining the benefits of heat pumps and traditional furnaces.',
    },
    {
      title: 'How Do Ductless Mini-Splits Compare?',
      description: 'Ductless mini-splits are a specialized type of air-source heat pump. They can function as standalone units for individual rooms or be integrated into your existing HVAC system for a more comprehensive solution. Whether you are looking to control the climate in a single room or multiple zones, ductless mini-splits offer precise temperature control without the need for extensive ductwork.',
