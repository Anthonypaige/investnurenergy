### **Bluetti AC300 + B300: A Versatile Power Solution**

Priced at only $2600, the Bluetti [AC300 + B300 system](shopping/affiliate-marketplace) offers a lot. It is a versatile power station with a capacity of 3.07kWh. It comes with a 3000-Watt Pure Sine Wave inverter, allowing for an impressive 6 KW of Surge Power and 3KW of Continuous AC Output Power. The AC charging input is 3000W (with a 30A charging cable), allowing for a fairly good charging time of 1.5 hours. They have a DC/solar input of 2400W, which if used at that max would charge the system in a quick 2 hours.

### **Bluetti AC500+ B300S: Powering High-Demand Devices**
