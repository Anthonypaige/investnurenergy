Low and Moderate-Income (LMI) households typically bear three times the energy burden (the portion of their income spent on home energy) compared to others. This disproportionate burden often leads to difficult choices between essential needs and energy bills. HEEHRA aims to alleviate this energy burden by focusing on electrification upgrades and offering substantial rebates, making a positive impact on both the environment and consumers' wallets.

### **What is the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA?) **

The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA) is a groundbreaking piece of legislation that's part of the larger Inflation Reduction Act. It's designed to make energy-efficient home upgrades more accessible, especially for LMI households. The act provides a full 100% credit for low-income households earning less than 80% of the state median income, and a 50% point-of-sale rebate for moderate-income households earning between 80% and 150% of the state's median income.

### **What is covered in the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act (HEEHRA? **

The act covers a range of products and services focused on Home Climate and Household Essential Appliances, specifically chosen to reduce energy consumption and costs.

### **Home Climate**

- **Heat Pump**: Heating and cooling are responsible for almost half of residential energy costs. Upgrading to a heat pump HVAC system, which produces three times the amount of energy it uses, can significantly reduce heating and cooling costs, making homes more comfortable year-round.

- **Weatherization**: Insulation and Sealant improvements aid in the efficiency of the HVAC unit. Proper insulation helps keep homes warm in winter and cool in summer, cutting energy costs. Learn more about weatherization in our [comprehensive guide](link article).

- **Ventilation**: Proper ventilation ensures healthy indoor air quality and aids in the efficiency of the HVAC unit, enhancing overall well-being.

### **Household Essential Appliances**:

- **Hot Water**: Heating water accounts for nearly 20% of residential energy costs.Heat Pump Water Heaters are three times more efficient, lowering water heating expenses.

- **Laundry**: Heat Pump Clothes Dryers utilize the same heat pump technology as heat pumps and HPWHs, translating to savings on electricity bills.

- **Cooking**: Electric Stoves and Electric Cooktops offer efficient cooking, reducing energy consumption. Electric Stoves are at least twice as efficient as gas stoves and produce much less waste heat that can make your kitchen uncomfortable in the summer.

These provisions collectively offer up to $14,000 for low-income households and up to $8,000 for moderate-income households.
