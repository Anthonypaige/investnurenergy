  title="Frequently Asked Questions"
  columns={1}
  items={[
    {
      title: 'What is Home Energy Storage?',
      description: 'Home energy storage uses advanced battery systems to store electricity for future use. These systems can capture energy from various sources, including the grid, solar panels, and wind turbines. They serve as a backup power source during outages and help optimize energy costs.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Are Solar Panels Required to Claim a Home Battery Tax Credit?',
      description: 'As of early 2023, you can claim the Residential Clean Energy Credit for a standalone battery purchase. While pairing a battery with solar panels maximizes savings and grid independence, a home battery alone can also provide benefits like emergency backup power and energy arbitrage opportunities.'
    },
    {
      title: 'What Are Time-of-Use (TOU) Rates?',
      description: 'Time-of-Use rates are fluctuating electricity prices that depend on the time of day. These rates are lower during off-peak hours and higher during peak demand times. A home energy storage system enables you to strategically use stored energy to avoid higher rates.'
    },
    {
      title: 'Can I Integrate a Home Battery with My Existing Solar Panel System?',
      description: 'Integrating a home battery with an existing solar panel system largely depends on your current inverter setup and the type of battery you choose. However, many universal home battery options are designed to be compatible with a variety of solar inverter systems, making integration relatively straightforward.'
