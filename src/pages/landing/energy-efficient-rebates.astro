      Our page is dedicated to helping you understand and take advantage of both state-level rebates and the federal Electrification Rebate Act (HEEHRA). Unlike tax credits, these rebates are direct financial incentives that come from state-level programsâ€”even when backed by federal acts like HEEHRA.
