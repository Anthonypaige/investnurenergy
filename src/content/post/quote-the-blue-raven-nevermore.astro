n the burgeoning world of renewable energy, solar companies like Blue Raven Solar often appear as saviors, promising a greener planet and lighter utility bills. But what if these promises are nothing more than a mirage? In this article, we pull back the curtain on Blue Raven Solar and its parent company, SunPower, exposing a series of unethical practices that have left countless homeowners in financial ruin. We're risking tens of thousands of dollars in lost affiliate commissions to bring you this information, but the truth is priceless.

### The Mirage of the "Net Price": A Masterclass in Deception
Blue Raven Solar employs the term "net price" in a way that deliberately misleads customers into believing it encompasses all associated costs. What they don't reveal is that this so-called "net price" is bloated with an exorbitant 40% in dealer fees. But the deception doesn't end there.

**The Deceptive Inclusion of Interest**
These dealer fees are so strategically inflated that they mimic the amount one would expect to pay in interest over a 25-year loan period. This creates the illusion that the interest is already included in the "net price," leading customers to think they're getting a better deal than they actually are.

**The Tax Credit Fallacy**
Furthermore, Blue Raven Solar insinuates that customers can apply the 30% tax credit not just to the upfront cost but also to this inflated interest amount. Not only is this misleading, but it's also not legally permissible. The tax credit is meant for the cost of the solar system itself, not the interest accrued over the life of the loan.

By employing these tactics, Blue Raven Solar traps customers in a financial snare, making it nearly impossible for them to realize any return on investment (ROI).

### The Illusion of Savings: Unveiling the Smoke and Mirrors
Blue Raven Solar entices customers with the alluring offer of **"18 months free, $0 down, no hassle,"** along with the promise of potential savings on utility bills. However, this is where the company's transparency ends and manipulation begins. Contrary to their insinuations, Blue Raven Solar encourages customers to use their tax returns freely, making their bridge loan option appear far more flexible and appealing than it truly is.

**The Bridge Loan Trap: A Financial Quicksand**
We've delved into the complexities of solar loans in our previous article on [navigating the pitfalls of solar loans](#), and bridge loans stand out as particularly treacherous. Blue Raven Solar fails to disclose that if the tax credit isn't applied to the bridge loan within the stipulated time frame, the interest rate can soar dramatically. This sudden and unexpected surge in monthly payments can financially cripple homeowners, effectively obliterating any chance of a return on investment (ROI).

By employing these cunning tactics, Blue Raven Solar not only jeopardizes the financial stability of homeowners but also tarnishes the reputation of the solar industry. Their practices serve as a cautionary tale, highlighting the urgent need for consumer awareness and industry regulation.

### SunPower: The Complicit Partner in Crime
**Did SunPower acquire Blue Raven?** The answer is a resounding yes, and their culpability in these unethical practices is equally glaring. SunPower is fully aware of the deceptive tactics employed but chooses to remain conveniently indifferent. Their affiliate marketing program is so financially rewarding that even trusted platforms like Bob Vila and This Old House are reluctant to expose them.

**The Dark Side of Affiliate Marketing: A Cautionary Tale**
Affiliate marketing has the potential to be a force for good, helping companies expand their reach and consumers find quality products. However, when misused, it becomes a breeding ground for unethical behavior. SunPower's affiliate marketing program is so lucrative that it has ensnared even reputable platforms, who then hesitate to call out the company's unethical practices for fear of losing affiliate income.

### Why This Matters to Us: A Ricky Gervais Moment
As a platform that also engages in affiliate marketing, we could easily look the other way and rake in substantial profits from a relationship with Blue Raven Solar and SunPower. In fact, our accountant estimates that publishing this article could cost us tens of thousands of dollars in lost affiliate commissions. But here's the thing: **We don't care.**

This is our Ricky Gervais moment, a point where we choose to call out the industry's BS, regardless of the financial implications. Our mission is to provide honest, transparent information to our readers, and we refuse to compromise that integrity for dirty money.

By taking this stand, we aim to be a part of the solution, encouraging a more ethical and transparent solar industry for the benefit of consumers everywhere.

### **Conclusion: The Cost of Silence is Too High**
The solar industry has the potential to revolutionize how we consume energy, but companies like Blue Raven Solar and SunPower are casting a long, dark shadow over this bright future. Their unethical practices not only exploit consumers but also undermine the credibility of an entire industry. While we could have stayed silent and profited from affiliate marketing relationships with these companies, we chose to speak out. The cost of silence is too high, especially when it comes at the expense of consumer trust and financial well-being. We hope this article serves as a wake-up call for both consumers and the industry at large. It's time to demand better.
