Sense Home Energy Monitors are more than just energy tracking devices. These compact devices, connected directly to your home's electrical panel, offer real-time insights into your power usage and solar production. The distinguishing factor is Sense's advanced machine learning technology.

### **Machine Learning: The Driving Force Behind Sense Monitors**

Sense Home Energy Monitors are equipped with high-resolution current sensors that do more than just measure power usage. These sensors identify unique electrical signatures from your appliances and devices, effectively 'learning' your home's energy patterns. This identification process allows Sense to provide real-time insights into which devices are on and how much power they're using. This level of detail is invaluable for understanding your energy habits, identifying energy-intensive appliances, and finding opportunities for energy savings. For instance, Sense's machine learning technology can distinguish between the electrical signatures of a refrigerator and a television, providing you with a granular view of your energy consumption.

#### **High-Resolution Data: The Secret to Sense's Device Detection**

Sense Home Energy Monitor's clamp-on current sensors take current and voltage measurements over 1 million times every second. This incredibly high-resolution data is used to derive the electrical signatures of individual devices. This high-frequency data collection allows Sense to 'see' when devices turn on and off, providing real-time insights into your energy consumption. For example, Sense can detect when your washing machine starts its spin cycle or when your oven is preheating, helping you understand the energy impact of these activities.

#### **Device Detection: Making Sense of Your Energy Consumption**

Once Sense has collected enough data, it uses machine learning algorithms to identify your devices based on their unique electrical signatures. This process, known as device detection, can take some time as Sense needs to see enough contextual data to reliably detect each device. However, even before Sense has fully identified all your devices, you can start to see their impact on your energy consumption. Simply turn a device on or off and watch the real-time Power Meter in the Sense app. This immediate feedback can help you understand the energy impact of your devices and make more informed decisions about their use.

### **Sense App and Smart Home Integration: A Unified Energy Management Solution**

The Sense Home Energy Monitor is not just a device, but a comprehensive solution for managing your home's energy consumption. Central to this solution is the Sense app, a user-friendly dashboard that provides real-time and historical data, tracks energy trends, and allows you to set goals for energy usage. The app keeps you informed about your home's energy activity with notifications about your energy usage, such as when devices turn on or off. For instance, you could receive a notification when your laundry is done or when your garage door opens, providing you with real-time insights into your home's energy usage.

Sense also integrates with other smart home devices, including Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Philips Hue, and IFTTT. This integration enhances the system's capabilities, allowing for more detailed energy tracking and automation.
