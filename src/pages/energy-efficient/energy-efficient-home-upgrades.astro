  items={[
    {
      title: 'What Is the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Tax Credit (25C)?',
      description: '25C is a federal tax credit designed to encourage homeowners to make energy-efficient upgrades, especially in heating and cooling, which accounts for 50% of home energy costs. The credit covers a variety of home improvements, including insulation, windows, heat pumps, and water heaters.'
    },
    {
      title: 'What Is the Annual Limit of 25C?',
      description: 'As of January 1, 2023, the annual limit for the 25C credit is $3,200, a significant increase from the previous lifetime limit of $500. This makes it even more beneficial for homeowners to invest in energy-efficient improvements.'
    },
    {
      title: 'How to Determine 25C Eligibility?',
      description: 'Eligibility for the 25C credit is based on specific energy-efficient upgrades, as outlined by the IRS. Since it is a tax credit, you need sufficient tax liability to claim it. For a personalized assessment, consult our IRA Eligibility Calculator.'
    },    
    {
      title: '25C vs HEEHRA: What Are the Differences?',
      description: 'Both 25C and HEEHRA focus on energy-efficient home improvements, specifically for controlling heating and cooling costs. However, 25C is a federal tax credit, while HEEHRA is a federally approved, state-level rebate program offering point-of-sale rebates for approved low and moderate-income households.'
    },
    {
      title: '25C vs 25D: What Are the Differences?',
      description: 'Both 25C and 25D offer a 30% tax credit, but they target different aspects of home energy. 25C focuses on energy-efficient upgrades and improvements with an annual limit of $3,200 and no rollover option. On the other hand, 25D is geared towards renewable energy systems like solar panels and wind turbines, has no annual limit, and offers a rollover option.'
