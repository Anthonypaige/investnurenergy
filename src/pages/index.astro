classes={{ container: 'max-w-6xl' }}
items={[
   {
      title: 'What energy efficient home upgrades are eligible for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C)',
      description:
        "Eligible upgrades under the 25C tax credit include insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, and certain types of roofs and HVAC systems. These improvements must meet specific energy efficiency criteria to qualify. The credit covers 10% of the cost, up to $500, with certain limitations for each type of upgrade.",
    },
    {
      title: 'What clean energy is included in the Residential Clean Energy Property Credit? (25D)',
      description:
        "The 25D tax credit covers solar panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines, and fuel cells. These systems must be installed in your primary residence or a second home, but not rental properties. The credit generally covers 26% of the installation costs with no upper limit.",
    },
    {
      title: 'When can I claim these tax credits?',
      description:
        "Credits can only be claimed in the year the property is installed. There is no lifetime limit, but yearly limits do apply. It's crucial to keep all receipts and Federal Certification Statements to validate your claim.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Can federal tax credits be carried forward to the next tax year?',
      description:
        "Clean Energy covered under 25D has a rollover option, allowing you to carry forward unused credits to future tax years. However, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) does not offer a rollover option, so it's use-it-or-lose-it within the same tax year.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Can I claim credits for improvements made to my second home or rental property?',
      description:
        "Yes, credits are available for certain improvements made to second homes. Renters may also be eligible if they make eligible improvements to their principal residence.",
