  items={[
    {
      title: 'What Benefits Does the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Offer?',
      description:
        "The Inflation Reduction Act is a landmark legislation that aims to tackle various economic and environmental challenges. One of its key provisions is the focus on energy efficiency and clean energy production. The act allocates significant funds for energy security and climate change programs. If you are looking to make your home more energy-efficient or invest in clean energy, this act provides various tax credits and incentives to help you do so.",
    },
    {
      title: 'What Clean Energy Options are Included in the Residential Clean Energy Property Credit? (25D)',
      description:
        "The 25D tax credit encompasses a range of clean energy solutions, including solar panels, solar water heaters, geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines, and fuel cells. These systems must be installed in your primary residence or a second home, but rental properties are excluded. The credit generously covers 30% of the total installation costs, without any upper limit.",
    },
    {
      title: 'How Do Electric Vehicles (EVs) Fit Into the Energy Efficiency Equation?',
      description:
        "Electric vehicles are a cornerstone of a sustainable future. The 30D tax credit offers a substantial incentive for purchasing a new EV, covering up to $7,500 of the cost. Additionally, the 30C credit provides a 30% rebate for the installation of an EV charging station at your residence, further promoting the adoption of clean transportation.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Can I Benefit from Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credits?',
      description:
        "Absolutely! The Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit, also known as 25C, offers tax credits for specific energy-saving improvements made to your primary residence. This includes insulation, energy-efficient windows and doors, and certain HVAC systems. Unlike 25D, this credit does not roll over, so it is crucial to claim it in the tax year the improvements are made.",
    },
    {
      title: 'What is the Difference Between Tax Credits and Rebates?',
      description:
        "Tax credits, such as those under 25C, 25D, and 30C, directly reduce your tax liability, offering substantial savings when you file your taxes. On the other hand, HEEHRA and 30D offer instant rebates, providing immediate financial relief at the point of purchase or installation.",
    },
    {
      title: 'Can Federal Tax Credits Be Carried Forward to the Next Tax Year?',
      description:
        "Tax credits under the 25D provision offer flexibility with a rollover option, allowing you to carry forward any unused credits to future tax years. However, the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) is a one-time opportunity; unused credits cannot be rolled over to the next tax year.",
